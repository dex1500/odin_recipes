    <h1 class="headerrec1">Posh cheese sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../img/sandwich.jpg" alt="magnificent AND posh sandwich with cheese">
    <h3 class="headerrec2">This is a very good sandwich, one of the best there is!</h3>
    <p class="header">However, not only it is good, but also it is magnificent! Truly fascinating and likeable.</p>
    <p>In order to eat it, you need to prepare it, which can be difficult. But if you listen to the things I say, you will achieve success</p>
    <p>And these are the things I'm talking about:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><a class="bullet2">bread</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet2">cheese (best cheddar)</a></li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>As I CLEARLY mentioned earlier, this is a very diffucult thing to do so you better follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><a class="bullet3">Cut the bread (watch out not to cut yourself!)</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Cut the cheese (this is difficult - if you cannot do it, ask someone!)</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Put the cheese on bread</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>As I said, difficult but now ready! Now you eat!</p>

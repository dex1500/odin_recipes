    <h1>Posh cheese sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../img/sandwich.jpg" alt="magnificent AND posh sandwich with cheese">
    <h3>This is a very good sandwich, one of the best there is!</h3>
    <p>However, not only it is good, but also it is magnificent! Truly fascinating and likeable.</p>
    <p>In order to eat it, you need to prepare it, which can be difficult. But if you listen to the things I say, you will achieve success</p>
    <p>And these are the things I'm talking about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>bread</li>
        <li>cheese (best cheddar)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>As I CLEARLY mentioned earlier, this is a very diffucult thing to do so you better follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the bread (watch out not to cut yourself!)</li>
        <li>Cut the cheese (this is difficult - if you cannot do it, ask someone!)</li>
        <li>Put the cheese on bread</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As I said, difficult but now ready! Now you eat!</p>

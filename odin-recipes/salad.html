    <h3>This is salad everone can make! EVEN YOU, dummy! ;)</h3>
    <p>However, not only it is easy, but also it is delicious! Truly tasty and very good.</p>
    <p>In order to eat it, you need to prepare it, which is very simple. You just need to prepare it and put it on a plate. So so easy!</p>
    <p>And these are the things really need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>little bit of lemon</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>and also something else to eat, something that doesn't taste like air hahaha </li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>As I CLEARLY mentioned earlier, this is a very easy thing to do and EVEN YOU should be able to do it. You only need to make sure that you follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the shop</li>
        <li>Steal the lettuce, lemon and olive oil</li>
        <li>Haha only kidding you dummy - go back to the shop and pay to the nice lady</li>
        <li>Go back home</li>
        <li>Wash the lettuce</li>
        <li>Add some drops of lemon juice from the lemon you bought</li>
        <li>Add some drops of olive oil from the olive oil bottle you bought</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And voila! Now you eat! (best with something else, like meat or sausage</p>

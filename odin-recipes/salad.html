    <h3>This is the world's famous Magic Burger!</h3>
    <p>However, not only it is magic, but also it is magnificent! Truly remarkable and easy to make.</p>
    <p>In order to eat it, you need to prepare it, which is very simple. You just need to prepare everything and put things between the two slices of a bun. So so easy!</p>
    <p>And these are the things I'm talking about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>bun</li>
        <li>beef burger</li>
        <li>tomato</li>
        <li>red oninon (it can't be a regular onion, it has to be red and if it's not then you die</li>
        <li>yellow thing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As I CLEARLY mentioned earlier, this is a very easy thing to do and EVEN YOU should be able to do it. You only need to make sure that you follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Do the burger (medium is good)</li>
        <li>Separate two slices of the bun</li>
        <li>Put the burger on the bun</li>
        <li>Put the tomato on top of the burger</li>
        <li>Put the onion (RED!) on top of the tomato</li>
        <li>Put the yellow thing all over everything</li>
        <li>Put the second part of the bun on top of everything</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And voila! Now you eat!</p>

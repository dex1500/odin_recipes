    <h3 class="headerrec2"> This is salad everone can make! EVEN YOU, dummy! ;)</h3>
    <p class="header">However, not only it is easy, but also it is delicious! Truly tasty and very good.</p>
    <p>In order to eat it, you need to prepare it, which is very simple. You just need to prepare it and put it on a plate. So so easy!</p>
    <p>And these are the things really need:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><a class="bullet2">lettuce</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet2">little bit of lemon</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet2">olive oil</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet2">and also something else to eat, something that doesn't taste like air hahaha </a></li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>As I CLEARLY mentioned earlier, this is a very easy thing to do and EVEN YOU should be able to do it. You only need to make sure that you follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><a class="bullet3">Go to the shop</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Steal the lettuce, lemon and olive oil</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Haha only kidding you dummy - go back to the shop and pay to the nice lady</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Go back home</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Wash the lettuce</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Add some drops of lemon juice from the lemon you bought</a></li>
        <li><a class="bullet3">Add some drops of olive oil from the olive oil bottle you bought</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>And voila! Now you eat! (best with something else, like meat or sausage</p>
